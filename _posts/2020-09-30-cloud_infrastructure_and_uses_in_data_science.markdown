## What is Cloud Computing?

Cloud computing is the act of running workloads within clouds—which are IT environments that abstract, pool, and share scalable resources across a network. Neither cloud computing nor clouds are technologies unto themselves.

* Cloud computing is an act—the function of running a workload in a cloud.
* Clouds are environments—places where applications run.
* Technologies are things—software and hardware used to build and use clouds.

## Whats is Cloud infrastructure?

Cloud infrastructure is a term used to describe the components needed for cloud computing, which includes hardware, abstracted resources, storage, and network resources. Think of cloud infrastructure as the tools needed to build a cloud. In order to host services and applications in the cloud, you need cloud infrastructure.

## What's included in cloud infrastructure?

Cloud infrastructure is made up of several components, each integrated with one another into a single architecture supporting business operations. A typical solution may be composed of hardware, virtualization, storage, and networking components.

As a term, cloud infrastructure can be used to describe a complete cloud computing system—once all the pieces are put together—as well as the individual technologies themselves.

## Components of cloud infrastructure

### Hardware

Although you probably think of clouds as being virtual, they require hardware as part of the infrastructure.

A cloud network is made up of a variety of physical hardware that can be located at multiple geographical locations.

The hardware includes networking equipment, like switches, routers, firewalls, and load balancers, storage arrays, backup devices, and servers.

Virtualization connects the servers together, dividing and abstracting resources to make them accessible to users.


### Virtualization

Virtualization is technology that separates IT services and functions from hardware.

Software called a hypervisor sits on top of physical hardware and abstracts the machine's resources, such as memory, computing power, and storage.

Once these virtual resources are allocated into centralized pools they’re considered clouds.

With clouds, you get the benefits of self-service access, automated infrastructure scaling, and dynamic resource pools.

### Storage

Within a single datacenter, data may be stored across many disks in a single storage array. Storage management ensures data is correctly being backed up, that outdated backups are removed regularly, and that data is indexed for retrieval in case any storage component fails.

Virtualization abstracts storage space from hardware systems so that it can be accessed by users as cloud storage.

When storage is turned into a cloud resource, you can add or remove drives, repurpose hardware, and respond to change without manually provisioning separate storage servers for every new initiative.

### Network

The network is composed of physical wires, switches, routers, and other equipment. Virtual networks are created on top of these physical resources.

A typical cloud network configuration is composed of multiple subnetworks, each with varying levels of visibility. The cloud permits the creation of virtual local area networks (VLANs) and assigns static and/or dynamic addresses as needed for all network resources.

The cloud resources are delivered to users over a network, such as the internet or an intranet, so you can access cloud services or apps remotely on demand.

## Type of Cloud

### Public Cloud

A public cloud environment is owned by an outsourced cloud provider and is accessible to many businesses through the internet on a pay-per-use model. This deployment model provides services and infrastructure to businesses who want to save money on IT operational costs, but it’s the cloud provider who is responsible for the creation and maintenance of the resources.

Public clouds are ideal for small and medium sized businesses with a tight budget requiring a quick and easy platform in which to deploy IT resources.

#### Pros of a public cloud

* Easy scalability
* No geographical restrictions
* Cost effective
* Highly reliable
* Easy to manage

#### Cons of a public cloud

* Not considered the safest option for sensitive data

### Private Cloud

This cloud deployment model is a bespoke infrastructure owned by a single business. It offers a more controlled environment in which access to IT resources is more centralised within the business. This model can be externally hosted or can be managed in-house. Although private cloud hosting can be expensive, for larger businesses it can offer a higher level of security and more autonomy to customise the storage, networking and compute components to suit their IT requirements.

#### Pros of a private cloud

* Improved level of security
* Greater control over the server
* Customisable

#### Cons of a private cloud

* Harder to access data from remote locations
* Requires IT expertise

### Hybrid Cloud

For businesses seeking the benefits of both private and public cloud deployment models, a hybrid cloud environment is a good option. By combining the two models, a hybrid cloud model provides a more tailored IT solution that meets specific business requirements.

#### Pros of a hybrid cloud

* Highly flexible and scalable
* Cost effective
* Enhanced security

#### Cons of a hybrid cloud

* Communication in network level may be conflicted as it’s used in both private and public clouds.

## Cloud Services

There are three main service models of cloud computing – Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS) and Software as a Service (SaaS). There are clear differences between the three and what they can offer a business in terms of storage and resource pooling, but they can also interact with each other to form one comprehensive model of cloud computing.

#### IaaS (Infrastructure as Service)

This is the most common service model of cloud computing as it offers the fundamental infrastructure of virtual servers, network, operating systems and data storage drives. It allows for the flexibility, reliability and scalability that many businesses seek with the cloud, and removes the need for hardware in the office. This makes it ideal for small and medium sized organisations looking for a cost-effective IT solution to support business growth. IaaS is a fully outsourced pay-for-use service and is available as a public, private or hybrid infrastructure.

#### PaaS (Platform-as-a-Service)

This is where cloud computing providers deploy the infrastructure and software framework, but businesses can develop and run their own applications. Web applications can be created quickly and easily via PaaS, and the service is flexible and robust enough to support them. PaaS solutions are scalable and ideal for business environments where multiple developers are working on a single project. It is also handy for situations where an existing data source (such as CRM tool) needs to be leveraged.

#### SaaS (Software as a Service)

This cloud computing solution involves the deployment of software over the internet to variousbusinesses who pay via subscription or a pay-per-use model. It is a valuable tool for CRM and for applications that need a lot of web or mobile access – such as mobile sales management software. SaaS is managed from a central location so businesses don’t have to worry about maintaining it themselves, and is ideal for short-term projects.
