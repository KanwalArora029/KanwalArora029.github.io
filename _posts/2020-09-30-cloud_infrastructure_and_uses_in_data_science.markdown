## What is Cloud Computing?

Cloud computing is the act of running workloads within clouds—which are IT environments that abstract, pool, and share scalable resources across a network. Neither cloud computing nor clouds are technologies unto themselves.

* Cloud computing is an act—the function of running a workload in a cloud.
* Clouds are environments—places where applications run.
* Technologies are things—software and hardware used to build and use clouds.

## Whats is Cloud infrastructure?

Cloud infrastructure is a term used to describe the components needed for cloud computing, which includes hardware, abstracted resources, storage, and network resources. Think of cloud infrastructure as the tools needed to build a cloud. In order to host services and applications in the cloud, you need cloud infrastructure.

## What's included in cloud infrastructure?

Cloud infrastructure is made up of several components, each integrated with one another into a single architecture supporting business operations. A typical solution may be composed of hardware, virtualization, storage, and networking components.

As a term, cloud infrastructure can be used to describe a complete cloud computing system—once all the pieces are put together—as well as the individual technologies themselves.

## Components of cloud infrastructure

### Hardware

Although you probably think of clouds as being virtual, they require hardware as part of the infrastructure.

A cloud network is made up of a variety of physical hardware that can be located at multiple geographical locations.

The hardware includes networking equipment, like switches, routers, firewalls, and load balancers, storage arrays, backup devices, and servers.

Virtualization connects the servers together, dividing and abstracting resources to make them accessible to users.


### Virtualization

Virtualization is technology that separates IT services and functions from hardware.

Software called a hypervisor sits on top of physical hardware and abstracts the machine's resources, such as memory, computing power, and storage.

Once these virtual resources are allocated into centralized pools they’re considered clouds.

With clouds, you get the benefits of self-service access, automated infrastructure scaling, and dynamic resource pools.

### Storage

Within a single datacenter, data may be stored across many disks in a single storage array. Storage management ensures data is correctly being backed up, that outdated backups are removed regularly, and that data is indexed for retrieval in case any storage component fails.

Virtualization abstracts storage space from hardware systems so that it can be accessed by users as cloud storage.

When storage is turned into a cloud resource, you can add or remove drives, repurpose hardware, and respond to change without manually provisioning separate storage servers for every new initiative.

### Network

The network is composed of physical wires, switches, routers, and other equipment. Virtual networks are created on top of these physical resources.

A typical cloud network configuration is composed of multiple subnetworks, each with varying levels of visibility. The cloud permits the creation of virtual local area networks (VLANs) and assigns static and/or dynamic addresses as needed for all network resources.

The cloud resources are delivered to users over a network, such as the internet or an intranet, so you can access cloud services or apps remotely on demand.
